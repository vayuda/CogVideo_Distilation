A rugged cowboy rides his horse along a winding dirt trail at dawn. The golden sun begins to rise over distant mountains, casting long shadows across the serene desert landscape. The terrain is vast and open, with scattered cacti and dry bushes dotting the sandy ground. The cowboy, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and a dust-covered duster coat, sits firmly in the saddle as his horse gallops forward. The sky is a blend of soft oranges and purples with scattered clouds. The camera smoothly pans, keeping the cowboy and horse centered in the frame. Photorealistic, cinematic lighting, dynamic movement.
